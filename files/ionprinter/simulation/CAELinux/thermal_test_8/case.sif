! Graphite value are a rough approximation to the data provided in
! Lutcov, A. ., Volga, V. ., & Dymov, B. . (1970).
! Thermal conductivity, electric resistivity and specific heat of dense graphites.

! Specific heat data is from Thermal Properties of G-348 Graphite
! Donald M. McEligot, W. David Swank, David L. Cottle, Francisco I. Valentin
! Mr. Swank, you've got a cool name.

!I've confirmed that the volume resistance values returned are sane for Aluminum.

!For comparison, using
!graphite data directly from McMaster-Carr,
!(dividing ohms/sq by the thickness of the sheet, which is horrifically inaccurate)
!I get 0.00001397 ohm-meters
!or 71582 S/m.

!Screw this.
!I just put my block of graphite across my bench supply,
!and obtained a value of 0.66 ohms,
!1968.5 S/m.

!Using my bench meter in Kelvin-probe mode, I obtained a value of
!0.221 ohms,
!5873.9 S/m.
