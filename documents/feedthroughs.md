An amazing reference on electroadhesion:

Anodic bonding to alumina might just be possible.

Reverse bias leads to a deteriorated bond quality. That's interesting.

### Spark plugs

Spark plugs apparently use a talcum powder ring for sealing. Very unusual. I'm going to look into this.

In any case, the plug body is typically made of a nickel steel alloy.

All right! Looks like I'll probably have to weld the plugs in two stages - first braze a copper transition tube to the nickel, and then braze that to the aluminium.

Purchased some NGK D8EA non-resistor gasket copper-core plugs. These have an M12 x 1.25 thread and a 19 mm reach.

Solder wets the tip of these plugs very well if the surface is sanded slightly.

Brazing to ceramic is totally possible:
