Barium Ferrite is a good high-temperature magnet material; good to ~300c, sinterable,  pretty spicy in terms of toxicity.  See <https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b2/26/d8/8714585053693a/US4457851.pdf>

Requires ~10K Oersted magnetizing field; somewhere around 150 kA/m - 750A for a 0.5 cm bit.



Saturation energy product might be a more useful spec; this is 5 to 12 kJ/m^3 for BaFe. (Ormerod and Constantinides 1997). Some hobbyists have made their own magnetizing coils with a big cap. 

Could use a thyristor for triggering.
