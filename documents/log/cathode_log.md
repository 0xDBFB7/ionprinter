Using "Mary Kay base coat / top coat" clear nail polish - almost full, 7.5 mL bottle. I am unsure of its precise composition. 

a[^commercial_coatings] describes mixtures of metal carbonates at 22 to 44% W/V. A 30% w/v BaCO3 solution was chosen, requiring the addition of approximately 2.25 grams of BaCO3.

The carbonate did not immediately form a homogenous solution; magnetic stirring was required.

Four Nichrome 80 filaments were wound with 4 turns around a 2.38 mm mandrel: two 24 AWG, and two 32 AWG.

The wire hadn't been cleaned before winding, so the coils were sprayed with IPA. Ultrasonic cleaning would probably have been preferable: if this technique is not found to work, surface contaminants may be the cause.

Two of the coils were dipped in the solution. Two remained uncoated to act as controls.

<hr>

Another strike against barium oxide cathodes: the temperature-resistivity curve for nichrome is pretty funky and surjective, whereas tungsten's curve is quite well-behaved.
