Oh, and it costs the same as a first generation Makerbot Cupcake. That was made out of wood.

How is this possible?

Uh... we've got a device that can produce arbitrary geometries out of almost any material





[closeup, ceramic pcb blinking with STM32]

This is a printed circuit board.

If you look closely, you might notice a few unusual properties.

64 layers, 

[microscope shot]

alumina ceramic substrate.

For one thing, there's no solder; the copper merges with the components - almost as if the board had been built around the ICs somehow. The traces are all thinner and thicker, this one is a vertical smiley face, this switch is actually a DNA double helix, this one just turned into iron,  [gradually more absurd geometries]

also,

[zoom out rapidly, board still blinking]

it's twisted into a mobius strip.

[Hammer smashes it to demonstrate that it is still ceramic]

It's fine, let me make a new one.

Overlay: 26 minute print: $3.4.

Here's a Borromean teacup. The cup is ceramic lined with copper, and the handle is pure iron.





Dialog: "Today I have to make a thermionic cathode out of rat poison, nail polish, and vape wire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this process has not been well described in the literature."



A note on customer support:



I think this device is most useful if it's accessible to everyone. The beauty of an entirely novel Unfortunately, due to the complex operating principle, making the nrdditron affordable to hobbyists may be orthogonal with maintaining 1-on-1 customer support, so I can't guarantee the level of customer service that one of the major manufacturers can provide.

nrditron? Priceless.

oh ha I'm going to be smiling in the video so one could say I'm "beaming" haha

One of the diffusion pump videos shows me struggling to open a bottle of 704. Might make a good rest 



PCB in profile,

rotate,



get nassault to go over the video 



use lightswitch trick from nassault's new seeds video



"it's even portable!"

"er... nice day"





Wright pub scene style rapid vacuum hiss, part removed from chamber 



One of the videos captured recently shows the turbo controller smoking. To make this more clear, I can xor the video with a clip a few seconds before to isolate the smoke.
