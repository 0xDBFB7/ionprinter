Oh, and it costs the same as a first generation Makerbot Cupcake. That was made out of wood.

How is this possible?

Uh... we've got a device that can produce arbitrary geometries out of almost any material





[closeup, ceramic pcb blinking with STM32]

This is a printed circuit board.

If you look closely, you might notice a few unusual properties.

64 layers,

alumina ceramic substrate.

For one thing, there's no solder; the copper merges with the components - almost as if the board had been built around the ICs somehow. The traces are all thinner and thicker, this one is a vertical smiley face, this switch is actually a DNA double helix, this one just turned into iron,  [gradually more absurd geometries]

also,

[zoom out rapidly, board still blinking]

it's twisted into a mobius strip.

[Hammer smashes it to demonstrate that it is still ceramic]

It's fine, let me make a new one.

Overlay: 26 minute print: $3.4.

Here's a Borromean teacup. The cup is ceramic lined with copper, and the handle is pure iron.





Dialog: "Today I have to make a thermionic cathode out of rat poison, nail polish, and vape wire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this process has not been well described in the literature."



A note on customer support:



I think this device is most useful if it's accessible to everyone. The beauty of an entirely novel Unfortunately, due to the complex operating principle, making the nrdditron affordable to hobbyists may be orthogonal with maintaining 1-on-1 customer support, so I can't guarantee the level of customer service that one of the major manufacturers can provide.

One of the videos captured recently shows the turbo controller smoking. To make this more clear, I can xor the video with a clip a few seconds before to isolate the smoke.

All future improvements will remain open-source. Ideally, any upgrades that are made as the technology progresses will be printable on the device itself, though this may not be possible in some cases.

#### Limitations



There will likely be a few consumables; these print modules will probably require replacement every few thousand hours, or about every 10 kg printed; but there will never be any kind of DRM on those, so other vendors will probably appear. The business model is not predicated on profiting from parts wearing out or planned obsolescence, since that's a dick move; rather, we're selling the device for a reasonable price and then trying to support it as well as possible.

If we profit significantly from replacement parts, there is no motivation for us to improve the reliability of our product. This would be a sad state of affairs.

There will never be any sort of planned obsolescence.





The D in DRM stands for Douchebag

The original Short Circuit intro (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUQIKnrZVTM>) is entirely close-up macro shots. The camera never moves, it's just a series of jump cuts of motion. The sound is prominent over the music.  The action sequence is 2 minutes long. Everything's slow and methodical; it's clearly distinct from a simple montage.

Nobody is visible; hands are gloved, everything visible is mechanical.

> So, I've run up against a bit of a stumbling block. I need to know the electron impact momentum balance of aluminum and copper; that is, when an electron and - say - aluminum particle get in a fiery wreck, which way do each fly off. So I tried to find the predictive theory that governs this, only to find that - to the embarrassment of physicists - it doesn't appear to have been fully developed yet. The best fits available only get within half an order of magnitude.
