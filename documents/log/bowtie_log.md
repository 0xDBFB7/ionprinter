emissivity is a surface phenomenon! A thin layer of tungsten could be sputtered onto the bowtie if power consumption is excessive!

OOOH how about a dip in aluminum oxide? Nope - emissivity of alumina is 0.2-0.5, not really enough to make a difference

tungsten oxide powder could be applied to the bowtie and then reduced with hydrogen to form tungsten.

laser cutter graphite sintering?

Laser cutter photodiode alignment

Or even just a laser on the CNC

Looks like it'll be very difficult to cut graphite with the laser. Sinter quality looks terrible, too.

going to be hard to make this nozzle focused enough to not deposit onto the surface of the chamber. Little needle?

Maybe I can drill the graphite visually - hook up the elp camera and try to line it up by hand

If the graphite bowtie is prone to cracking, we can instead use reinforced carbon-carbon, built up by resin-filled sheets then pyrolized.
