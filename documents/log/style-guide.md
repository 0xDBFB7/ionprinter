As Feynman said, it's more important to be clear rather than precise:

> **The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language.** The [desire](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Desire) is to have the idea clearly communicated to the other person. It is only necessary to be precise when there is some doubt as to the meaning of a phrase, and then the precision should be put in the place where the doubt exists. **It is really quite impossible to say anything with absolute precision, unless that thing is so abstracted from the real world as to not represent any real thing.**

I find that I often drift into obtuse and jargon-filled terminology, which greatly hinders understanding. Acronyms are to be abhored. 

If a technique or technology (or even variable!) is named properly, one often finds that the name alone gives you some intuitive understanding of what it means, and how it operates. "Jacobi solver" is less descriptive than Jacobi Relaxation. "Standard Deviation Of The Mean". All variables in all equations should be labeled immediately below. Any magic constants or empirical fits should have units attached.

Everything in this project should be converted to SI + eV units.
