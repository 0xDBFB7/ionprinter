As Feynman said, it's more important to be clear rather than precise:

> **The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language.** The [desire](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Desire) is to have the idea clearly communicated to the other person. It is only necessary to be precise when there is some doubt as to the meaning of a phrase, and then the precision should be put in the place where the doubt exists. **It is really quite impossible to say anything with absolute precision, unless that thing is so abstracted from the real world as to not represent any real thing.**
