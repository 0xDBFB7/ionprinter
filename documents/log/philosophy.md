Why's this here? I don't know, I'm not a psychologist.

Apparently unlike many animals, humans have the capacity to construct an internal model of the world. This allows us to generalize known situations with new inputs. 

It seems to me that the key to good science is to always ensure that this mental model is consistent with reality. It is quite easy to construct an imaginary universe which seems perfectly correct and self-consistent - a universe where your beliefs about human nature, sociology, or a fault in an electronics board are all correct.

Incidentally, this statement itself is one of those constructed realities.

The cost of production should be lower than the cost of customer support would be - if any problem arises, we automatically ship out a replacement, no human involved. I'd rather spend money on R&D and in-field testing than a call center.

Bandcamp-like price for consumables?



Muskrat Nihilism

I saw a muskrat today, sifting timidly among some bushes.

This has been a strange year for me, full of things without apparent purpose - that 

But what meaning has the Muskrat to continue with its toil? What internal logic does it compute to justify its foraging? Has it even the neural complexity to know why it scampers away at the twitch of a leaf - to understand that it is merely another cog in the billion-year-old clock we call life?

Answers are not forthcoming from the muskrat.

So my new-year's resolution is to think more like the muskrat. 



If at some point your line of reasoning strays near "because people are stupid", you are not going to solve your problem. People aren't stupid. Average people are of average intelligence. 

I've often been of the mind that when two options are presented, one should choose the third. Innovation creates that third path.

#### Vertical integration



I hesitate to write this. Putting pen to paper turns a thought, a malleable entity, into a rigid document. I try to minimize this level of rigidness in my company; however, I think this is such a powerful concept that 



Why does vertical integration work?



This seems a bit counterintuitive, and a few years ago I was of an antipodal position. Specialization is one of the driving principles of modern society; few are required to learn how to grow crops, the intricacies of animal husbandry, how to teach their children, or the thousands of other functions which would have been essential for survival in previous centuries. This is really quite terrific, and has increased productivity and the quality of life immensely. I do not decry progress! 





It seems contradictory. Contractors can employ dozens of employees exquisitely experienced

- Every situation is very slightly different

- Every time you do something hard, you learn a bit more, and transfer a bit more knowledge into the people who work for you.
