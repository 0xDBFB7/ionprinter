Why's this here? I don't know, I'm not a psychologist.

Apparently unlike many animals, humans have the capacity to construct an internal model of the world. This allows us to generalize known situations with new inputs. 

It seems to me that the key to good science is to always ensure that this mental model is consistent with reality. It is quite easy to construct an imaginary universe which seems perfectly correct and self-consistent - a universe where your beliefs about human nature, sociology, or a fault in an electronics board are all correct.

Incidentally, this statement itself is one of those constructed realities.

The cost of production should be lower than the cost of customer support would be - if any problem arises, we automatically ship out a replacement, no human involved. I'd rather spend money on R&D and in-field testing than a call center.

Bandcamp-like price for consumables?



Muskrat Nihilism

I saw a muskrat today, sifting timidly among some bushes.

This has been a strange year for me, full of things without apparent purpose - that 

But what meaning has the Muskrat to continue with its toil? What internal logic does it compute to justify its foraging? Has it even the neural complexity to know why it scampers away at the twitch of a leaf - to understand that it is merely another cog in the billion-year-old clock we call life?

Answers are not forthcoming from the muskrat.

So my new-year's resolution is to think more like the muskrat. 



If at some point your line of reasoning strays near "because people are stupid", you are not going to solve your problem. People aren't stupid. Average people are of average intelligence. 

I've often been of the mind that when two options are presented, one should choose the third. Innovation creates that third path.

#### Vertical integration



I hesitate to write this. Putting pen to paper turns a thought, a malleable entity, into a rigid document. I try to minimize this level of rigidness in my company; however, I think this is such a powerful concept that 



Why does vertical integration work?



This seems a bit counterintuitive, and a few years ago I was of an antipodal position. Specialization is one of the driving principles of modern society; few are required to learn how to grow crops, the intricacies of animal husbandry, how to teach their children, or the thousands of other functions which would have been essential for survival in previous centuries. This is really quite terrific, and has increased productivity and the quality of life immensely. I do not decry progress! 





It seems contradictory. Contractors can employ dozens of employees exquisitely experienced 

- You lose information and detail every time you transfer

I think everyone’s encountered this. You tell someone what to do,

- Every situation is very slightly different
- Every time you do something hard, you learn a bit more, and transfer a bit more knowledge into the people who work for you.

#### Copying

#### Can I build one and sell it?

Yes, please do. This is an intentional feedback mechanism to prevent me from becoming complacent, to force this company to continuously innovate in many different fields as rapidly as possible. This serves society best, I think. Otherwise, I think I would most probably become content to rest on laurels and await the inevitable obsolescence.

Moreover, patents are completely useless.

One caveat: you may not use the [name] or [hargrave sciences], or imply any sort of endorsement by me or this company. I will be mad if you do.

#### I have more resources than you, can I build this before you and beat you to market?

Kind of a dick move! But yeah, you could do that too.



#### I do not concern my self with patents or copyright

Emotion: on/off with dry/wet prose.

I do not concern myself with patent or copyright. I do not feel society can be bettered by my obtaining either.

First, I must be deferential to the giants who ultimately bear my weight. The books describing every nook, crevice, and handhold in theory itself, the thousands of research papers whose facts and figures have been cast into the very soul of this device, the videos and blogs describing the nuances of obscure techniques; the discussion forums where many a fact has been distilled from opinion; all made possible purely by those who put pen to paper and disseminated what they learned for the benefit of the public[1]. I am proud to have been given the opportunity to join their ranks.

In addition, this device is *simple*. The fundamental physical concepts behind this device have been known for more than a century. Heavy ion beams were created way back in the Manhattan project. Feynman discussed ion-beam printers in his 1969 lecture, "Plenty of Room At The Bottom."[2a,b], and they have been used for decades in the industry. The only two aspects that I can even remotely be given any possible credit for are the recombination of a previously-directed beam to work around charge-density limitations, and the lowering of cost by an order of magnitude by way of copious vertical integration. The first, even, is dubious; the second is obvious.

Secondly, what business do I have in cordoning off a section of Nature herself for my own purposes? That does not seem appropriate.

Third, if someone succeeds in overtaking me, in developing more effective and efficient solutions, I have nobody to blame but myself. I must be ever-vigilant in my product and quality.

Fourth, I grow restless. I must not be content to rest on the laurels of this product, with fame and fortune delivered to me; that way lies only obsolescence, madness, and the dirty tricks and shrewd bankers of business. I require an impetus to continue to do my duty and must be forced to contribute to society in whatever negligible fashion I am able to. If that impetus includes bankruptcy, so be it.

> 

In essence, I do not wish to be an entrepreneur, but a scientist. My biases should be ever in the favor of truth, not public relations and economic incentives, and I hope that open-sourcing all I learn posthaste will assist me with this. Any companies I may form - and any money I may make - should exist purely to drive knowledge, under punishment of doom.

Note that above I make no claims here as to the general usefulness of patents or copyright, only describing how I believe they apply to *myself* and *my process*. It would be ridiculous to foist these same principles on others.

Basically, I wanna work on neat stuff, and tell others about it. This printer probably won’t save anyone’s life or help society immeasurably, but a future project might. End of story.

Whatever. Please buy my product?

1. It forces you to innovate more.


A company with patent protection can 

\2. Even if you disagree with the above reasons: there really isn’t an alternative. Patents take an insane amount of time and money to file (which you could have used to innovate past your competition), they only give you protection in one or two countries, and enforcing a patent is difficult on its own.



Patents are also supremely negative for society as a whole. First, they don’t disseminate nearly enough information to be useful. The really difficult and costly part of any product is the implementation and validation, not the mere idea. As an example, one project I undertook was thought up in the shower, but took nearly 2 years to theoretically verify with physics simulations, and another 2 years and $10,000 to determine exactly what kind of metal to use in a heater. Not every idea is physically practical or useful; and almost all are lacking in one or the other.

If a society is going to have a useful patent system, it must scientifically verify that an invention is practical and useful, and require that the applicant describe **very precisely how it was made and how it works,** without “plurality” nonsense; it must be easily replicable with minimal effort by someone knowledgeable in the field; essentially, it should be a journal paper from academia. I believe that effectively implementing such a system is impossible.



This project should not have worked. I made several grievous errors in the scientific methods used; I delayed running analyses because I was afraid of the results; I really *needed* it to work. This is contrary to the interests of good science, and it is truly only by luck that it has progressed this far.





#### External funding

However, I believe it is possible to conduct a substantial amount of research purely via internal, self-funded enterprises. 

The requirements of low-budget R&D align very closely with the optimizations required for ; simplified designs. Monetarily limited development must often be more rigorous and theoretical, with simulations, 

A series of very subtle changes in behavior occur when you involve another party monetarily. For instance, my previous project (the SafeSump) was attached early on to a partner company. For a variety of reasons, the emphasis shifted from obtaining a finished, polished product to obtaining a functioning prototype to demonstrate. 

Rather than slowly and methodically working through each issue, characterizing, specifying, and optimizing each unit of the product, bug fixes were tacked onto designs and manufactured immediately. This led to a perverted cycle of rushed testing, crude prototype assembly, and hasty revision. Breadboarding of new solutions was not done; untested modules were appended and invariably underperformed.

Even unit testing was forfeited in favor of manual testing, ostensibly to save time. 

"top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches to development are both equally legitimate, and an argument could be made for both in this circumstance; but this was a bastardized version of neither.

This was *entirely* my fault; nobody else is to blame, and I am wrong if I ever think the opposite.



I have found time and again that it is very worthwhile to conduct a sort of "basic research", the kind that business abhors. When one pursues curiosity down an uncharted path, one is bound to find new techniques and . Unfortunately, management structures, production metrics, and oversight seem to be actively
