Why's this here? I don't know, I'm not a psychologist.

Apparently unlike many animals, humans have the capacity to construct an internal model of the world. This allows us to generalize known situations with new inputs. 

It seems to me that the key to good science is to always ensure that this mental model is consistent with reality. It is quite easy to construct an imaginary universe which seems perfectly correct and self-consistent - a universe where your beliefs about human nature, sociology, or a fault in an electronics board are all correct.

Incidentally, this statement itself is one of those constructed realities.

The cost of production should be lower than the cost of customer support would be - if any problem arises, we automatically ship out a replacement, no human involved. I'd rather spend money on R&D and in-field testing than a call center.

Bandcamp-like price for consumables?
