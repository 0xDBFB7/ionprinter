    Injector could be placed on the top. The top and bottom graphite heaters can be perpendicular.
    
Advantages:


Problems:
Collision with alumina wall is likely to cause high losses at high pressures.
No charge discrimination.

Electrostatic cone profile can be precisely adjusted to cancel out beam dispersion Ã  la microwave dishes.

The beam must be recombined before exiting the focus chamber. 

Z-pinch and helical B-fields can be added to increase ionization efficiency; these won't affect the ions but it will direct electrons. Care must be taken to ensure that these fields won't interfere with recombination.

Cone must be carefully positioned to prevent axial acceleration and the resultant X-rays. 

A phosphor+pmt interlock could be added for safety.

Why would the particles be compelled to move in a specific direction? With AC B input, would the entire arrangement not be perfectly symmetrical?

The region where wire is injected must be colder than the melting point of the wire, else gas will escape. A large radiator can be attached to the nozzle.
