### Print materials

Aluminum and Copper were my target metals. I originally planned on testing with Zinc, due to its low boiling point. However, pure zinc wire is quite difficult to come by, so I couldn't do testing with injector feed systems. 

The design isn't validated with any other materials, though anything that can survive ionization (single elements, essentially - compounds will be quite thoroughly destroyed) and has reasonable boiling temperatures and ionization energies should work.

### Cost.

It would suck to build this only to have it be reserved for institutions or companies: it must be affordable to the hobbyist, like current 3d printers. 

Including high vacuum pump but excluding the external roughing pump (~$200) must cost less than $1000 to build.

### Print speed

I figured 40 grams per hour was a reasonable starting point - 2.232Ã—10^20 atoms of aluminium per second. For comparison, current FDM 3d printers can usually do somewhere around 10g/h. Since aluminum has around 3x the density of PLA, however, the volumetric print speed will be nearly on par.

Aluminum is much stronger than PLA, though, so thinner walls and lower density infills can be used.

### Power consumption

For reasons described later, power is a significant constraint. The unit should be compatible with a standard 15-amp breaker, so the maximum power consumption has to be less than 1800 watts - 1400 watts or so after power supply losses.

### Shipping

International shipping'll be insane if this thing weighs more than 15-20kg. Some sort of telescopic arrangement would be ideal.
