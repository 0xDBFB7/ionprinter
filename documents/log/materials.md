Viton, copper, brass, aluminium, etc.



Polyethylene TML is anywhere between 0.13 and 0.46. Teflon and Rulon are generally >0.01. Viton is considerably higher, at ~0.2%.

Brass is problematic at high temperatures due to zinc outgassing.

Macor is actually surprisingly reasonable. A 1/2" x 3" x 3" block only costs around $60.
