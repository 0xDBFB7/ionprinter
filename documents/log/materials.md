Viton, copper, brass, aluminium, etc.



Polyethylene TML is anywhere between 0.13 and 0.46. Teflon and Rulon are generally >0.01. Viton is considerably higher, at ~0.2%.

Brass is problematic at high temperatures due to zinc outgassing.

Macor is actually surprisingly reasonable. A 1/2" x 3" x 3" block only costs around $60.

UV lamps are recommended for chamber bakeout - thanks Applied Ion!

FR-4 PCBs have surprisingly low outgassing - a full FR-4 stackup has < 0.4% TML and 0.01% CVCM.
