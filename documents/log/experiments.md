### Dan's Fast Thin Beam Approximation

#### Background: 

Designing the focus and recombination lens poses no small challenge. High beam rigidity and charge density make conventional extractor systems difficult to implement. The radial velocity kick requirements 

Manual extractor design proved to be too slow, even with highly optimized GUI workflows and automated diagnostics.

Closed-form solutions do not exist for many possible extractor systems.

This problem is an ideal application for evolutionary design via genetic algorithms. Unfortunately, the computational intensity of standard PiC beam simulators like Warp and IBSimu make these techniques ineffective - a minimal mesh required over 3 seconds to converge on 16 cores.

 After nearly a year was spent attempting to design th
