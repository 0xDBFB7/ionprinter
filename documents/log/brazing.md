### Brazing aluminum

Purchased some Benzomatic AL-3 aluminum soldering rods from Canadian Tire. Encountered some difficulty in attaining the required temperature. Melted my jacket in the process.

Tried preheating with an electric stovetop element. The element itself got to nearly 500c, but 

Standard table salt is effective as a flux. AvE recommends using a glass rod to remove dross.
