### Brazing aluminum

Aluminum brazing rod: seems like pre-heating is important. Someone on youtube uses a barbecue to great effect.

Purchased some Benzomatic AL-3 aluminum soldering rods from Canadian Tire. Encountered some difficulty in attaining the required temperature. Melted my jacket in the process.

Tried preheating with an electric stovetop element. The element itself got to nearly 500c, but the aluminum only got to around 300c - below the ~400c required for the AL-3 rods.

Many voids were found in the final braze - it was not in any way airtight. This may be due to the fact that it was not clamped properly.

Standard table salt is effective as a flux. AvE recommends using a glass rod to remove dross.
