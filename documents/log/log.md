Based on last night's progress on the ion beam focus theory, I'm doing some beam simulations with IBSimu to see exactly what kind of magnetic field I'm going to need. 

http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/examples/analytic_bfield.html

If you do things just wrong, you get this lovely output. Friggin' Jackson Pollock #4, that's what that is.



Some great info from[^5]

[^5]: Doni, Michele. "Optimization of the ion extraction from an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) by IBSimu modeling." (2013). [Internal](../../references/1545067618.pdf) [External](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/81162/3/thesis.pdf)



IBSimu doesn't seem to say anywhere what the bfield units are. I'm assuming they're tesla, since we're running SI and not CGS? To verify, I'm going to check the radius:
$$
r=\frac{mv\sin(\omega)}{qB}
$$
Main beam velocity:
$$
9990.616\text{ m/s}=\sqrt{\frac{2(15eV)}{29\text{ amu}}}
$$

$$
\text{if } B=1\text{ Tesla } r = \text{0.0030 m (3 mm)}
$$


Inconclusive. I can't tell if the path curvature is due to space-charge effects or due to the magnetic field.

https://sourceforge.net/p/ibsimu/mailman/message/28479056/ says SI units are used.

Ah, here we go. Units are definitely Tesla.



![null](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/null.png)

Here's what we get with no magnetic field, 15eV, 1eV normal and transverse.

![1T](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/1T.png)

1T field in +Z.

Putting a field in +Y crashes IBSimu.

A KJ magnetics RXC88 magnet has a peak 7T field:![ring3.50000-5](../../references/ring3.50000-5.png)

![7T](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/7T.png)

<hr>

Acceleration power:

$$
15eV \times 2.232Ã—10^{20}\text{ particles/sec} = 536.4\text{W}
$$

Whew. That's a bunch. 

<hr>
$5.985eV$ will be emitted upon recombination - almost assuredly in the form of a photon with a wavelength of 207nm. That's intense. Probably can't put a window on this thing, though glass and polycarbonate both block almost all  far UV. Have to see if the OD is high enough for safety.

<hr>

Electrostatic focusing seems to be completely ineffective at these high current densities.

![no_effect](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/no_effect.png)

The LHC's beam current is only around 0.54A. Our beam current will be roughly 66.2 times higher!

<hr>

Oh, if your cylindrical BC is wrong you'll get bad data. Doesn't affect the above.

<hr>
We've got around 7 cm of chamber radius as our maximum focus constraint.

![gradient](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/gradient.png)

A 5T gradient just about does it.



Remembered that accelerators use quadrupole and sextupole magnets for focusing. Researching why. 

![gradient_extreme](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/gradient_extreme.png)

Man, that is killer. A ~3t field for 0.2+ m. That's going to be tricky to pull off without superconductors. How's the focusing after that?

![partial_gradient](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/partial_gradient.png)

![full_gradient](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/full_gradient.png)

Yup, that all makes sense, looks good. Pretty stable at 35.75a of beam current and 15eV. Good stuff.

![gradient_30eV](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/gradient_30eV.png)

The exact same test at 30eV or 5eV accel. produces identical plots - as expected via analytical methods.

Nulling out the space charge effects doesn't seem to have a large impact on the trajectories. Very strange.

Same for the epot.  

Same even for the bfield. Huh.

Without:

![no_scharge_epot](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/no_scharge_epot.png)

With:

![with_scharge](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/with_scharge.png)

Okay, so there is a slight difference. I guess the scharge effects just aren't big enough yet.

![narrow_input](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/narrow_input.png)

Narrowing the input makes the output wider? Le what? Hmm, might be an artifact of the different magnetic field.

![narrow_long](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/narrow_long.png)

Looks roughly the same. Let's try a lower field with a longer distance to convergence.

![no_scharge_long](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/no_scharge_long.png)

Yeah, our paths are definitely straight now.

![gaussian_2](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/gaussian_2.png)

Using a crude gaussian/gaussian distribution for the magnetic field now. Strange "crossover" effect which remains even if the magnet is moved further away.

![loopy](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/loopy.png)

20T may be slightly too strong.

![crossover_10t](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/crossover_10t.png)

Yeah, still happening. I'm sure future readers have written me off as an idiot. Oh hey, is the magnetic field being mirrored across the x axis? I'm not sure. 

Let's first get a slightly more accurate magnetic field curtesy FEMM.

Ooh, https://www.particleincell.com/starfish/ looks really nice. Later.

Some ideas for ease of servicing:

Each control board can have an analog mux that takes ~16 voltages and pipes them into the main controller for self-test functionality.

There could be a little multimeter probe going to an ADC so that the user doesn't need an oscilloscope to troubleshoot the system.

A hall probe can be attached to the X/Y/Z? gantry and used to compensate for the magnetic field.

What kind of build platform are we going to use?

 Rulon or Delrin AF could be used for the linear motor slides.

<hr>

> The use of *FIELD_MIRROR* in case of symmetric cases, where beam is traversing next to the geometry boundary, is necessary to get physical results.

Ah.

Tried out 3d: A little bit too slow. IBSimu is only using one thread for some reason.

How about 2d?

I remembered that the UMFPACK lib wasn't installed when I configured this install of IBSimu. Installing and reconfiguring now - perhaps that'll speed things up a bit.

I love this processor. -j16 is so ungodly fast.

Had to compile SuiteSparse with 

`export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fPIC"` 

Nope, actually it's 

`SET(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)`

in some SuiteSparse cmake file. But that file doesn't exist anymore.

<hr>

Several hours later...

I'd already installed umfpack5 via apt, but it apparently missed the pkg-config .pc file. 

Ended up having to run `sudo dpkg -L libumfpack5`then write my own package description in a .pc and append it to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`.

Good stuff.

Anyway, cylindrical geometry is now unreasonably fast - 5 or 10 seconds.

Scratch that! Had the same solver enabled. The importance of controls and an impartial observer! That was some reprehensible science.

Okay, no, *that* was unreasonably fast. Reconfigured and reinstalled everything and now UMFPACK is definitely up and running.

<hr>

![no_collision](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/no_collision.png)

This crude 2D sim shows clearly where those spurious trajectories were coming from -  there's no collision at the boundaries.

Ah, and that's due to the PDB mirror values. Cool!

![now_talking](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/now_talking.png)

Here we go! A double-gaussian field with recombination.

![more_polish](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/more_polish.png)

Gradually tightening focus. I'm going to automate this process now.

I'm a little rusty in C++, apparently. Tried using fmt:: to procedurally generate filenames. 

I thought there was an easy way to batch-convert svgs to PNGs with linux, but apparently not - all suggestions require inkscape, which'll surely be quite slow. Switching to PNG export.

<video src="../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/bscan.mp4"></video>

BEAUTIFUL - a scan from 0 to 10T by .1T. Took somewhere around 2000 seconds.

<video src="../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/xbscan.mp4"></video>

![accidental](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/accidental.png)

Trying some piecewise functions.

What effect does the transverse temperature have on the beam?

Quick 20T test (no transverse or normal eV):

![20t](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/20t.png)

And 10T, for comparison:

![10t](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/10t.png)

Field strength doesn't seem to have a huge impact on the dot size beyond a certain point.

Let's get some better magnetic fields.

Exported magnetic field from FEMM using export.lua from https://www.particleincell.com/2012/femm-export/

Oh, right, I wanted to fix the vtu file export for Elmer. Next time.



Import's working, looks a little broken though.

Ah, just messed up the scaling.

![bfield_import](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/bfield_import.png)

![import_femm1](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/import_femm1.png)

Gorgeous!

Now adding recombination...done.

Oh, hang on. We're mainly interested in the Z-axis magnetic field.

![transposed](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/transposed.png)

I've temporarily transposed X for Z for some rough calculations - I'll probably have to spin up an Elmer 3D field calculation to really do this properly.

FEMM uses positive and negative turn numbers to denote solenoid polarity.

![aha](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/aha.png)

All right! Transposed Y for Z, some hundred amps going through two triangular coils...

![further_recombination](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/further_recombination.png)

Looks like there's a bit of beam distortion, presumably due to the strange coil shape:

![triangular_coil](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/triangular_coil.png)

Let me fix that.

![oh_my](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/oh_my.png)

Oh my! I may have set the coil current slightly too high. On the plus side, though, the beam is extremely tightly focused!

![slightly_more_sensible](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/slightly_more_sensible.png)

Oookay. Lots going on here. First, that's a friggin' 16 T field - surely I can whittle that down a bit. Secondly, it looks like the bulk of the beam focuses really nicely, but there's a few stragglers that are causing issues. And third, how the *heck* do you make a "Z axis" magnetic field? I still have to wrap my noodle around that one. Presumably CRTs are able to do it, but I haven't yet found a good description of CRT focus coils.

Ah, the 16T is only at the very periphery of the sim - other areas are ~8T.

Space charge effects are getting serious here - $0.004 \text{ C/m}^3$ peak. 

![magnets_relocated](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/magnets_relocated.png)

Spurious streams subsequently shifted. I moved the coil slightly further from the beam area. 

http://www.virginia.edu/ep/SurfaceScience/class2.html - neat resource on some vacuum theory.

((0.001 millipascals / ((ideal gas constant) * 270 Kelvin ))/10) * 6.022*10^23 = 2.6x10^13 molecules

![widened_magnets](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/widened_magnets.png)

Even less distortion. Lowish Bfield.

[Here](http://www.labguysworld.com/5FPn_CRT_Tester.htm) is some good discussion of CRT magnetic focus setups.

![FocusCoils_000](../../references/labguy/LabGuy's World_ 5FPn CRT TESTING_files/FocusCoils_000.jpg)





Running a quick axisymmetric FEMM sim to see what kind of field strengths would be acheivable with a copper coil. 
$$
Turns: 0.02m * 0.05m * 0.33mm^2 (22AWG wire cross sectional area) * 0.025m^2\approx3000
$$

$$
\pi*0.1*2=376m = 100 ohms
$$

All that for a measly half-tesla:

Building up some intuition from the simple solenoid equation:
$$
\text{(magnetic constant) * (1000 turns / meter) * 100 amps = 0.1257T}
$$
17 Ga wire (cross section of 1mm^2) 

Dammit, I really don't want to use superconductors. Ferrous core?

What happens if I extend the coil the entire length of the chamber?

Would liquid-cooled brass tubing work? We can use the magnet coil as part of a high current transformer.

<hr>

Oh! The main limitation to using this device as a plasma beam cutter would probably be the tendency for the ablated material to foul the vacuum chamber in short order. We can apply the same ionization principles to the cutter region - perhaps a high voltage could be applied to the build plate to draw the waste to a sacrificial plate of some sort? This would, of course, require quite a drastic re-design of the build platform. 

<hr>

Naming:

`Neutralized / Recombinant Directed Deposition of Ions`

`Ne/RDDI`

`N/RDDI`

<hr>

There don't seem to be any non-conductive  elements that are solid at room temperature. It'd be really great

<hr>

Can we spray other elements at the beam after recombination in order to create compounds? Better yet, can we have multiple beams? 

<hr>

100eV, wide coil:

![beam](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/beam.png)

15eV, same coil:

![15eV](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/15eV.png)

1000eV, same coil:

![1000ev](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/1000ev.png)

<hr>

Could I sinter copper powder and solder to make the solenoid? Possibly. McMaster-Carr 

Solenoid could also be made out of magnetic iron?

<hr>

My current chamber only allows us about 0.3m in which to focus. I might have to upgrade that later.

<hr>

[Mark H on Physics StackExchange:](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/249212/101785)

> Solenoid magnets can focus in both the X and Y planes, unlike quadrupoles. They are also simpler devices that don't require the precise alignment that a FODO array would require. The limitation on solenoid magnets is that they are only effective at focusing low-energy beams, like the positrons from your spallation source or primary electrons after being emitted from a cathode.

As expected. Cool.

<hr>

Use 3d printer to get cool macro pan shots

Taking advantage of vacuum for cooling; evaporative cooling? Small amount of liquid is injected into the foreline and evaporates, chilling the port. The water would probably wreak havoc on the roughing pump - some sort of trap could be added, but that would also have to be cooled. A separate refrigerant pump might be simpler.



<hr>

Now that I think about it, our IBSimu starting beam is really quite unphysical, in that it's almost perfectly collimated; there's no non-parallel components. Our beam won't be nearly as clean, and therefore won't focus quite as well as in the simulation.

<hr>

Trying Einzel lenses again. 

![einzel_test](../../files/ionprinter/simulation/IBSimu/simulations/magnetic_focusing_1/images/individual/einzel_test.png)

Interesting. Aperture-style lens, 1000v:

### Quick notes

Brass water jacket on diffusion pump - inside and outside soldered
Better yet, TIG welded output
flapper on diffusion pump for quick cycling without cooldown
diffusion pump cooling loop on oil?

Nail polish barium carbonate coating

plasma de-ionizes due to *black body radiation*? Wait, what? How does that work? That can't be. Perhaps it cools to below the ionization temperature, but it can't possibly spontaneously form an electron.
