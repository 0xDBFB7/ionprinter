Based on last night's progress on the ion beam focus theory, I'm doing some beam simulations with IBSimu to see exactly what kind of magnetic field I'm going to need.

If you do things just wrong, you get this lovely output. Friggin' Jackson Pollock #4, that's what that is.






### Quick notes

Brass water jacket on diffusion pump - inside and outside soldered
Better yet, TIG welded output
flapper on diffusion pump for quick cycling without cooldown
diffusion pump cooling loop on oil?

Nail polish barium carbonate coating

plasma de-ionizes due to *black body radiation*!

Pyrolytic graphite as mu-metal alternative

dumet glass-to-wire seal

Fresnel zone plate

ion curtain can use a grid
