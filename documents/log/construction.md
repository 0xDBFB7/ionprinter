# Mk3

Log starts at gauge.

Need to drill 8.80mm or 11/32 holes in some aluminum and weld with brazing rod.

Brazed. See Brazing.md.

Seemed like one of the crush gaskets didn't fully seal on one of the spark plug feedthroughs - but in fact the brazing was porus.

# Mk3-5

Using a scrap piece of aluminum from an old boat engine mount. Had a few holes, but I could work them into the design.

Milled on 6040.

| Tool size | XY feed   | Z feed | RPM   | Z step | Stepover |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1/8"      | 7 mm/s    | 1 mm/s | 13000 | 1 mm   | 50%      |
| 0.25"     | 11.6 mm/s | 1 mm/s | 13000 | 1 mm   | 50%      |
|           |           |        |       |        |          |

Vaporized an entire bottle of WD-40 as coolant. This permeated into the MDF spoilboard, gradually reducing the clamping force until the part broke loose. Part was salvageable.

Used an entire pack of 600-grit trying to knock down some of the rack-rash. My friend Arnold
