# Mk3

Log starts at gauge.

Need to drill 8.80mm or 11/32 holes in some aluminum and weld with brazing rod.

Brazed. See Brazing.md.

Seemed like one of the crush gaskets didn't fully seal on one of the spark plug feedthroughs, but in fact the brazing was porus.

# Mk3-5

Using a scrap piece of aluminum from an old boat engine mount. Had a few holes, but I could work them into the design.

Milled on 6040. Short stickout on 1/8".
