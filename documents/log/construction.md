# Mk3

Log starts at gauge.

Need to drill 8.80mm or 11/32 holes in some aluminum and weld with brazing rod.

Brazed. See Brazing.md.

Seemed like one of the crush gaskets didn't fully seal on one of the spark plug feedthroughs - but in fact the brazing was porus.

# Mk3-5

Using a scrap piece of aluminum from an old boat engine mount. Had a few holes, but I could work them into the design.

Milled on 6040.

| Tool size | XY feed   | Z feed | RPM   | Z step | Stepover |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1/8"      | 7 mm/s    | 1 mm/s | 13000 | 1 mm   | 50%      |
| 0.25"     | 11.6 mm/s | 1 mm/s | 13000 | 1 mm   | 50%      |

Vaporized an entire bottle of WD-40 as coolant. This permeated into the MDF spoilboard, gradually reducing the clamping force until the part broke loose. Part was salvageable.

Used an entire pack of 180-grit trying to knock down some of the rack-rash. My friend Arnold tried to flycut  the thing, but there was excessive chatter.

Used an oscillating palm sander with some 320-grit silicon carbide. Took it to a pleasant dull finish.

Cleaned 5 times with water and then isopropyl.

THIS THING looks BAMF.



Spun up a few more times, achieved a base vacuum level of around 0.8 millibar (660 micron) - still not great, but I shut everything down prematurely as heating was excessive.

Set up a liquid cooling system for the turbo.

Purchased some nichrome wire from DashVapes. Needed a card, amusingly.

Quite nervous around this thing right now; the clamping force on the turbo is almost surely insufficient. If it crashes, it will send high-energy shrapnel in all directions, including through my torso. I *like* my torso the way it is, thank you very much.



I raised the input voltage to the turbopump controller to 56v, which worked admirably. The turbo audibly spun up significantly.

Unfortunately, upon re-cycling the chamber, the controller exploded from the excess voltage, presumably spikes due to high startup current. I am unsure as to the cause; the mosfet drivers were clearly blown, but the mosfets themselves were also shorted. The drivers have headroom to 85v, and the mosfets are good to 100v - I can't imagine that switching noise got that high.
