R. P. Feynman, (1963). "Quantum Theory of Gravitation"...And so I'm stuck to have to continue this investigation, and of course you appreciate that this is the secret reason for doing any work, no matter how absurd and irrational and academic it looks: we all realize that no matter how small a thing is, if it has physical interest and is thought about carefully enough, you're bound to think of something that's good for something else."

Apparently unlike many animals, humans have the capacity to construct an internal model of the world. This allows us to generalize known situations with new inputs. 

It seems to me that the key to good science is to always ensure that this mental model is consistent with reality. It is quite easy to construct an imaginary universe which seems perfectly correct and self-consistent - a universe where your beliefs about human nature, sociology, or a fault in an electronics board are all correct.

Incidentally, this statement itself is one of those constructed realities.

The cost of production should be lower than the cost of customer support would be - if any problem arises, we automatically ship out a replacement, no human involved. I'd rather spend money on R&D and in-field testing than a call center.

Muskrat Nihilism

I saw a muskrat today, sifting timidly among some bushes.

This has been a strange year for me, full of things without apparent purpose - that 

But what meaning has the Muskrat to continue with its toil? What internal logic does it compute to justify its foraging? Has it even the neural complexity to know why it scampers away at the twitch of a leaf - to understand that it is merely another cog in the billion-year-old clock we call life?

Answers are not forthcoming from the muskrat.

So my new-year's resolution is to think more like the muskrat. 



If at some point your line of reasoning strays near "because people are stupid", you are not going to solve your problem. People aren't stupid. Average people are of average intelligence. 

I've often been of the mind that when two options are presented, one should choose the third. Innovation creates that third path.

#### Vertical integration



I hesitate to write this. Putting pen to paper turns a thought, a malleable entity, into a rigid document; something to be followed, rather than questioned. I try to minimize this level of rigidness in my company; however, I think this is such a powerful concept that 



Why does vertical integration work?



This seems a bit counterintuitive, and a few years ago I was of an antipodal position. Specialization is one of the driving principles of modern society; few are required to learn how to grow crops, to learn the intricacies of animal husbandry, how to teach their children, or the thousands of other functions which would have been essential for survival in previous centuries. This is really quite terrific, and has increased productivity and the quality of life immensely. I do not decry progress! 





It seems contradictory. Contractors can employ dozens of employees exquisitely experienced

Humanity's a massively redundant system with an MBTF of at least 10 million years.



#### Copying

#### Can I build one and sell it?

Yes, please do. This is an intentional feedback mechanism to prevent me from becoming complacent, to force this company to continuously innovate in many different fields as rapidly as possible. This serves society best, I think. Otherwise, I think I would most probably become content to rest on laurels and await the inevitable obsolescence.

Moreover, patents are completely useless.

One caveat: you may not use the [name] or [hargrave sciences], or imply any sort of endorsement by me or this company. I will be mad if you do.

#### I have more resources than you, can I build this before you and beat you to market?

Kind of a dick move! But yeah, you could do that too.



#### I do not concern myself with patents or copyright

Emotion: on/off with dry/wet prose.

I do not concern myself with patent or copyright. I do not feel society can be bettered by my obtaining either.

First, I must be deferential to the giants who ultimately bear my weight. The books describing every nook, crevice, and handhold in theory itself, the tens thousands of research papers whose facts and figures have been cast into the very soul of this device, the videos and blogs describing the nuances of obscure techniques; the discussion forums where many a fact has been distilled from opinion; all made possible purely by those who put pen to paper and disseminated what they learned for the benefit of the public[1]. I am proud to have been given the opportunity to join their ranks.

In addition, this device is *simple*. The fundamental physical concepts behind this device have been known for more than a century. Heavy ion beams were created way back in the Manhattan project. Feynman discussed ion-beam printers in his 1969 lecture, "Plenty of Room At The Bottom."[2a,b], and they have been used for decades in the industry. The only two aspects that I can even remotely be given any possible credit for are the recombination of a previously-directed beam to work around charge-density limitations, and the lowering of cost by an order of magnitude by way of copious vertical integration. The first, even, is dubious; the second is obvious.

Secondly, what business do I have in cordoning off a section of Nature herself for my own purposes? That does not seem appropriate.

Third, if someone succeeds in overtaking me, in developing more effective and efficient solutions, I have nobody to blame but myself. I must be ever-vigilant in my product and quality.

Fourth, I grow restless. I must not be content to rest on the laurels of this product, with fame and fortune delivered to me; that way lies only obsolescence, madness, and the dirty tricks and shrewd bankers of business. I require an impetus to continue to do my duty and must be forced to contribute to society in whatever negligible fashion I am able to. If that impetus includes bankruptcy, so be it.



In essence, I do not wish to be an entrepreneur, but a scientist. My biases should be ever in the favor of truth, not public relations and economic incentives, and I hope that open-sourcing all I learn posthaste will assist me with this. Any companies I may form - and any money I may make - should exist purely to drive knowledge, under punishment of doom.

Note that above I make no claims here as to the general usefulness of patents or copyright, only describing how I believe they apply to *myself* and *my process*. It would be ridiculous to foist these same principles on others.

Basically, I wanna work on neat stuff, and tell others about it. This printer probably won’t save anyone’s life or help society immeasurably, but a future project might. End of story.

Whatever. Please buy my product?

1. It forces you to innovate more.


A company with patent protection can 

\2. Even if you disagree with the above reasons: there really isn’t an alternative. Patents take an insane amount of time and money to file (which you could have used to innovate past your competition), they only give you protection in one or two countries, and enforcing a patent is difficult on its own.



Patents are also supremely negative for society as a whole. First, they don’t disseminate nearly enough information to be useful. The really difficult and costly part of any product is the implementation and validation, not the mere idea. As an example, one project I undertook was thought up in the shower, but took nearly 2 years to theoretically verify with physics simulations, and another 2 years and $10,000 to determine exactly what kind of metal to use in a heater. Not every idea is physically practical or useful; and almost all are lacking in one or the other.

If a society is going to have a useful patent system, it must scientifically verify that an invention is practical and useful, and require that the applicant describe **very precisely how it was made and how it works,** without “plurality” nonsense; it must be easily replicable with minimal effort by someone knowledgeable in the field; essentially, it should be a journal paper from academia. I believe that effectively implementing such a system is impossible.



This project should not have worked. I made several grievous errors in the scientific methods used; I delayed running analyses because I was afraid of the results; I really *needed* it to work. This is contrary to the interests of good science, and it is truly only by luck that it has progressed this far.





#### External funding

However, I believe it is possible to conduct a substantial amount of research purely via internal, self-funded enterprises. 

The requirements of low-budget R&D align very closely with the optimizations required for efficient production; simplified designs, 

Cost efficiency is also improved when budgets are tight; designs must be backed by rigorous theory and  simulations before they can be built and effective.

A series of very subtle changes in behavior occur when you involve another party monetarily. For instance, my previous project (the SafeSump) was attached early on to a partner company. For a variety of reasons, the emphasis shifted from obtaining a finished, polished product to obtaining a functioning prototype to demonstrate. 

Rather than slowly and methodically working through each issue, characterizing, specifying, and optimizing each unit of the product, bug fixes were tacked onto designs and manufactured immediately. This led to a perverted cycle of rushed testing, crude prototype assembly, and hasty revision. Breadboarding of new solutions was not done; untested modules were appended and invariably underperformed.

Even unit testing was forfeited in favor of manual testing, ostensibly to save time. 

"top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches to development are both equally legitimate, and an argument could be made for both in this circumstance; but this was a bastardized version of neither.

This was *entirely* my fault; nobody else is to blame, and I am wrong if I ever think the opposite.



I have found time and again that it is very worthwhile to conduct a sort of "basic research", the kind that business abhors. When one pursues curiosity down an uncharted path, one is bound to find new techniques and . Unfortunately, management structures, production metrics, and oversight seem to be actively  



There are no absolutes in engineering, and



More directly, filling out grant applications and conforming to government requirements takes valuable time which could be better spent on the science itself.



There is one exception to these concepts, however. 







"time is money" is true; however, I think that means that you should spend more time.

*- Feynman*

Having recently worked at length with a mathematician, I am beginning to realize the depth of the difference in philosophy between the mathematician and the physicist.

The mathematician in question has stated that they have not learned anything beyond the required course material. Even the physical properties that I find most captivating (the confusing, contradictory principles that drive a Crooke's Radiometer, for instance) were met with only a blank stare.

Of course, this is cheating; I'd already been primed; I could cross-reference with, say, solar-sails, whose reflective mylar sheets are clearly tuned to 

the photonic 



As an example, we once analyzed the differential property of two powers. My colleague wrote a magnificent and almost incomprehensible 3-page proof of the equation, which we both parsed through gradually. When the work was complete, however, I found the proof to be tremendously unsatisfying. 

The whole lot seemed as circular reasoning; I got the distinct impression that if I spent more time, if I really, truly understood the equation, there would be a deeper, more prosaic explanation that would seem almost obvious once stated. 

However, if I attempted to gain a geometric understanding of these calculus concepts, I found that I could 

To quote Feynman once again,

> It is better to learn concepts, rather than facts.

If one has a sufficient understanding of the underlying principles, the manifestations of these principles often become self-evident. There is no formula-sheet for the universe; at some time, someone derived each concept from lesser theory.

Many physical expressions are of this form. For instance, 

Of course, this is not a more 'correct' or 'better' philosophy; and indeed, as the subject in question becomes more and more complex, intuition becomes a poor or misleading guide. Using some convoluted corpuscle analogy to explain the behavior of photons will see you made a fool of in short order. However, I do not believe that it is wise to abandon the manner in which our brains seem to best visualize.

Rather, I think intuition is malleable enough to cope with even the most perverse principles. As long as the   strict character of the defining equation is strictly followed,

Part of the value of space travel is in the perfection it demands from the design process. Space is completely inhospitable, almost inaccessible, poses risks of natures not seen terrestrially, all while applying strict mass budgets that strain the edges of structural science.  

Only accelerator science even approaches such difficulty. Like a courtroom, aerospace is a crucible; in it we burn off pseudoscience and negligence until society is left with the core product; a deep, nuanced understanding of all subjects encompassed. With a safety factor of 1.1, one cannot afford to ignore minutia; and it is that very nuance which drives society forward. With 400,000 motivated individuals, one cannot afford to mismanage.

A second moonshot is the ideal option from almost every point of view except the one that truly matters. It is the straightforward, stepping-stone option. From the point of view of the impassionate scientist, the books have been written, the articles published. 

We must go to Mars not because it is easy, *but because it is hard.*

"Undertaking this project required reading approximately 20,000 pages of scientific literature.

Many of these papers date from the 1970s or earlier, with some even from the 1930s; but almost all were funded by taxpayer dollars."

"Few societal issues are simple enough to be accurately described in the credits of a video. Researching this, you will find the issue exceptionally one-sided."

"Scientific journals have, by mere historical circumstance, found themselves in the enviable position of holding the sum total of the world's knowledge for ransom. Scientists pay thousands to submit papers; in return, the journal finds (unpaid, volunteer) peer reviewers. Many journals no longer even offer to proofread papers. Perverse historical incentives mandate that these costs be borne."



"Then, obtaining access to each ~10-page paper generally costs between \$25-\$40 - precisely none of which, I must emphasize, goes to the researchers involved. Obtaining subscriptions is now so costly that even many universities are fully unable to afford the 7-figure fees."

"Had I been forced to purchase each of the papers involved through conventional channels, I would have spent nearly $60,000 - 10x the total cost of the entire project."

"This is not even a matter of copyright, merely a matter of access; scientists are almost always allowed to freely share these reports, and many of the papers this work was based on have been out of copyright for decades."

"Open access publishing is on the rise. If you wish to invigorate industry, if your society would benefit from high-tech solutions wrought from the universe trickling expediently to commercial applications, support these efforts."

"In the meantime, thank you to the likes of Andrea E, Aaron Swartz, and many others, who have sacrificed personally to allow scientists to stand on the shoulders of giants. "

Won't this be used to print guns? 

I'm not sure that will be a problem. That capability has existed for over a decade now with FDM printers, and despite media concern thus far not a single use has arisen.

As far as the evidence demonstrates, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" seems to be a very flawed statement; but the epidemiological data do not seem to support the idea that printers will cause mayhem. Perhaps the Venn diagrams of access to intricate, expensive equipment and homicidal maniacs don't overlap very much.



<hr>

Consumed by a project with only tenuous wisps of physical basis, I have become a model of the very misguided inventor I abhor so.

I've witnessed many greats, seeing their skills dim, stoop to the warm illusion of pseudoscience. An accomplished electrical engineer abandoning the theory that guided him so to obsess with perpetual motion. 

And now I, a mediocre designer clinging to the spoils of a cupped hand.



Previously, time-slicing was sufficient; multitasking between the business, university, and the project was just sufficient to maintain all. A great deal was accomplished in secret between 9:00 and 4:00 - of course, this is completely unfair to my long-suffering parents, whose marriage has been reduced by the stress of a business and a lazy, spoiled son.

Unfortunately, this pace is unsustainable, and I expended the head-start I was lucky to receive in university. Summer courses were passed by a mere 0.6%. The requirements of second-year courses alone exceed my already feeble brain-power; 

I fear that if I set it aside, it will be permanent; if the design constraints and figures are are allowed to fade, 3.5 years and 50,000 words will be lost to "no meaningful conclusion".

#### Concerning the ephemerality of twitter

Why is twitter so ephemeral?

I'm not sure I've ever read a tweet that didn't appear on my timeline or embedded in a post. 

I certainly don't browse someone's timeline exhausively like I might a blog or 


Of course, it is very reasonable to assume that I use twitter differently than others - I would be interested in others' experiences with the above.

But if this is more generally true, it would seem that a great deal of information is being lost. 

I learn a lot via twitter - even more so since my circle of friends increased a year ago. However, it's a distinct kind of learning; 
more tidbits that people that people discuss 

I am reminded of Feynman's advice to "Learn concepts, not facts". Maybe that's my fundamental problem - I spend all my time learning bits and gobs of trivia, while unstanding nothing of the underlying framework. 

It's interesting to contrast this with something like IRC. IRC is designed to be transient; it's realtime, what happens now is gone soon, so don't post anything valuable.
And yet, I've spent far more time 




#### Long-term plan

Part of the 'ideology' of the ionolith is that Hargrave Sciences will be replaced as the vendor. 

I would be very sad to find that my company has become 'IP obese'; to succumb to convergent design.

We needn't look far from the AM field for examples - c.f. Makerbot. What fantastic innovations has this company wrought? It seems that they have only succeeded in proprietarizing what was once public; by making black-box extruders with custom connectors; by raising prices where the competition's plummets. 

The ionolith is somewhat different from most products in a number of ways: 

The ionolith is perhaps one of the first truly self-replicating products. The device will be specifically designed to be produced using itself. 

No matter how much money is being made, production of Hargrave Sciences ionoliths will cease 4 years from the launch date; and all service will be terminated 6 months later.

This will allow us to focus on what truly benefits society, rather than just pumping out S/N N+1. In a century, 

For this to be successful, the design must be maintainable by the end-user, well-documented, and free of planned obscelescence.

By this date, the hardware and software of the product will surely be mature, and there won't be a good reason for the company to exist - beyond greed. 

From an existential perspective, to have started with an only to allow the company to be tarnished by time would be something of a miserable eulogy.
