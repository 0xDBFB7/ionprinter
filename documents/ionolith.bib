  title = {Note: this is the cringiest shit. I write this with a headache after hitting my head quite hard while shoveling. Also I tasted some weird stuff from a capacitive sensor, hopefully it wasn’t poisonous. [Act 1: 14 billion years.] tirades of generations fighting against the omniscient oppressor of increasing entropy; and somehow, winning. A miniscule patch of order in an increasingly homogeneous universe; a valiant effort of random chance to win against itself[1]; of intelligence, whatever form it may yet take, apparently reaching far beyond the stable strategies; social turmoils; hierarchy rising and falling; conquest; innovation; destruction on unimaginable scales; continents, then planets, falling to the ownership of few, then many. [Act 2: 50 billion years.] And now the stars that shone in the night sky were profoundly altered from the archaic myths against which civilization had once guided itself; but then night itself had lost meaning some billions of years ago, when - by means of nuclear decay chains - Ra himself abandoned the quiet planet that had once worshipped him. They found solace and energy in other systems; trading the red giants for passionate white dwarfs; Dyson spheres constructed, then destroyed in the sands of time; tales of complexity found and lost, as the language of man changed when he did; as bodies became incorporeal, so did thoughts and concepts within. Galaxies, once harnessed, now faded into the same dust that enclosed them all; a period of parsecs finding its spoils slip through the cracks of a cupped hand. [Act 3: 100 trillion years.] And now, nearing the end of the universe, constrained by the same exponential laws that allowed them to persist, the stars turned from inspiration to heat, to be feared by prey and found by foes[2]; life became imprisoned within the gravitationally constrained; the sky drew gradually more blank and featureless, with no niches to impart wisdom; resources became fully, entirely finite, in every sense of the word, with no hope for expansion possible, of riches just beyond the horizon; living itself radiated away the last drops of that which sustained it; the battles were won, but the fight was decided, though still all had not yet been spoken.[3] Or perhaps not. Life, after all, finds a way; the Copernican ideas of yesterday and the cosmological models of today may yet yield to a universe powered by darkness itself. This was a story about what was once a curious pattern of carbon atoms. Inspired by the hubble constant; the increasing redshift of light from other galaxies into infrared radiation; dark matter; the expansion of our sun into a red-giant [1]; clunky and cringy, but it’s evolution winning against the random processes of mutation [2]; pit vipers detect heat; I guess this is like an entropy-viper, searching for stars and sustenance; or perhaps it’s smaller scale, a mere shape looking above the horizon [3]; the reactions (chemical, electrical or otherwise) that power the beings must follow landauer’s constants; so no irreversible computation can take place without dissipating heat; I imagine beings of galactic proportions harnessing the fourth power in the stefan-boltsmann law, running at nearly absolute},

  title    = {Submitted to: Proc. Institute of Refrigeration (London)},
  year     = {8030},
  abstract = {This paper presents a review of the pulse tube refrigerator from its inception in the mid-1960s up 
to the present.  Various factors are discussed which brought it from a laboratory curiosity to the 
point where it is now the most efficient of all cryocoolers and reliable enough to be used on 
space missions.  Carnot efficiencies as high as about 20% at 80 K and temperatures as low as 2 K 
have been achieved in pulse tube refrigerators.  The operating principles for the different types of 
pulse tube and thermoacoustic refrigerators are described.  Pulse tube refrigerators operate with 
oscillating pressures and mass flows and have no moving parts in the cold end.  For large 
industrial systems the mechanical compressor can be replaced with one of two types of 
thermoacoustic drivers to yield a refrigerator with no moving parts.  Recent advances in 
understanding and reducing losses in various components are described that have led to the 
improved efficiencies.  The major problems associated with cryocoolers are listed, and it is 
shown that pulse tube refrigerators have begun to overcome many of these problems.  As a 
result, they are now being used or considered for many different applications.  Some of these 
applications as well as example pulse tube refrigerators are described. 
 
Introduction 
 
     The vapor-compression refrigerator, first developed in the latter part of the 19th century, has 
provided most of the world’s refrigeration needs during the 20th century.  In a single stage it can 
produce temperatures down to about 230 K (-43 °C), provided the appropriate refrigerant is used.  
Since the middle of the 20th century a steadily increasing demand for cryogenic temperatures 
(<120 K) has developed for a wide variety of applications.  Initially most of these applications 
were for the liquefaction of air and natural gas, for which very large plants have been developed.  
Power inputs of many megawatts are typical for these systems.  More recently a need for small 
cryogenic refrigerators (cryocoolers) has evolved for a variety of applications.  The requirements 
imposed in each of these applications have been difficult to meet and have been the impetus for 
considerable research and development in the field of cryocoolers for the past 40 years or so. 
     Table 1 lists the main problems associated with cryocoolers that have hampered the 
advancement of many applications.  For example, superconductivity would be in more 
widespread use now if it were not for the problems associated with the cryocoolers needed to 
cool the superconductors.  One such cryocooler, the pulse tube refrigerator, first conceived in the 
mid-1960s, was of academic interest until the mid-1980s.  Since then, improvements in its

  title  = {FEMM 4.2 Magnetostatic Tutorial1 David Meeker dmeeker@ieee.org January 25, 2006 1. Introduction Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) is a finite element package for solving 2D planar and axisymmetric problems in low frequency magnetics and electrostatics. The program runs under runs under Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP. The program can be obtained via the FEMM home page at http://femm.foster-miller.com. The package is composed of an interactive shell encompassing graphical pre- and post- processing; a mesh generator; and various solvers. A powerful scripting language, Lua 4.0, is integrated with the program. Lua allows users to create batch runs, describe geometries parametrically, perform optimizations, etc. Lua is also integrated into every edit box in the program so that formulas can be entered in lieu of numerical values, if desired. (Detailed information on Lua is available from http://www.lua.org.) There is no hard limit on problem size—maximum problem size is limited by the amount of available memory. Users commonly perform simulations with as many as a million elements. The purpose of this document is to present a step-by-step tutorial to help new users get "up and running" with FEMM. In this document, the solution for the field of an air-cored coil is considered. 2. Model Construction and Analysis This will take you through a step-by-step process to analyze the magnetic field of an air- cored solenoid sitting in open space. The coil to be analyzed is pictured in Figure 1. The coil has an inner diameter of 1 inch; an outer diameter of 3 inches; and an axial length of 2 inches. The coil is built out of 1000 turns of 18 AWG copper wire. For the purposes of this example, we will consider the case in which a steady current of 1 Amp is flowing through the wire. In FEMM, one models a slice of the axisymmetric problem. By convention, the r = 0 axis is understood to run vertically, and the problem domain is restricted to the region where r ≥ 0 . In this convention, positive-valued currents flow in the into-the-page direction},

  abstract = {-An improved sessile drop technique which prevented the oxidation of aluminum was used to
measure the changes in contact angle between boron nitride and molten aluminum in a purified He-3% H 2 
between 1173 and 1373 K. The contact angle progressed through the four wetting phases similar to other 
ceramics when the results were plotted on a logarithmic time scale. However, at and above 1273 K the 
equilibrium contact angle was 0 ° which is much less than those of typical ceramics. Using the value in 
phase II, the original contact angle between boron nitride and aluminum (contact angle between 
non-reacted boron nitride and aluminum) was estimated to be 133 ° at 1373 K. The wetting progressed 
by producing another non-wetting material, AIN, in this non-wetting system. The detailed mechanism of 
the solid/liquid/vapor interfacial advance during wetting in such a system was also explained using Cassie's 
equation.},

  abstract = {A comparative analysis of the experimental results of the properties of fresh and hardened concrete with different replacement ratios of natural with recycled coarse aggregate is presented in the paper. Recycled aggregate was made by crushing the waste concrete of laboratory test cubes and precast concrete columns. Three types of concrete mixtures were tested: concrete made entirely with natural aggregate (NAC) as a control concrete and two types of concrete made with natural fine and recycled coarse aggregate (50% and 100% replacement of coarse recycled aggregate). Ninety-nine specimens were made for the testing of the basic properties of hardened concrete. Load testing of reinforced concrete beams made of the investigated concrete types is also presented in the paper. Regardless of the replacement ratio, recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) had a satisfactory performance, which did not differ significantly from the performance of control concrete in this experimental research. However, for this to be fulfilled, it is necessary to use quality recycled concrete coarse aggregate and to follow the specific rules for design and production of this new concrete type.},

  title    = {Virtual Restoration of Stained Chinese Paintings Using Patch-Based Color Constrained Poisson Editing with Selected Hyperspectral Feature Bands},
  abstract = {Stains, as one of most common degradations of paper cultural relics, not only affect paintings’ appearance, but sometimes even cover the text, patterns, and colors contained in the relics. Virtual restorations based on common red–green–blue images (RGB) which remove the degradations and then fill the lacuna regions with the image’s known parts with the inpainting technology could produce a visually plausible result. However, due to the lack of information inside the degradations, they always yield inconsistent structures when stains cover several color materials. To effectively remove the stains and restore the covered original contents of Chinese paintings, a novel method based on Poisson editing is proposed by exploiting the information inside the degradations of selected three feature bands as the auxiliary information to guide the restoration since the selected feature bands captured fewer stains and could expose the covered information. To make the Poisson editing suitable for stain removal, the feature bands were also exploited to search for the optimal patch for the pixels in the stain region, and the searched patch was used to construct the color constraint on the original Poisson editing to ensure the restoration of the original color of paintings. Specifically, this method mainly consists of two steps: feature band selection from hyperspectral data by establishing rules and reconstruction of stain contaminated regions of RGB image with color constrained Poisson editing. Four Chinese paintings (‘Fishing’, ‘Crane and Banana’, ‘the Hui Nationality Painting’, and ‘Lotus Pond and Wild Goose’) with different color materials were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Visual results show that this method can effectively remove or dilute the stains while restoring a painting’s original colors. By comparing values of restored pixels with nonstained pixels (reference of their same color materials), images processed by the proposed method had the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE), normalized absolute error (NAE), and average differences (AD), which indicates that it is an effective method to restore the stains of Chinese paintings.},

  abstract = {The thermal and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) random copolymers (PEVA) and its covalently crosslinked analogues (cPEVA) were controlled by the overall crystallinity of the polymer networks. The cPEVAs with different VA-content were synthesized by thermally-induced crosslinking of linear PEVA with dicumyl peroxide (DCP). This work was mainly concerned with the effect of vinyl acetate (VA) content on the crosslinking density, thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs, respectively. The chemical composition was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis and 1H-NMR. The thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs have been studied through a series of conventional analytical methods, including gel content determination, different scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and traditional mechanical measurements. The experimental results show that the thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs increase with decreasing the VA-content. A broad melting transition with a Tm in the range from 78 C to 95 C was observed for all polymer networks.},

  title    = {Submitted to: Proc. Institute of Refrigeration (London)},
  year     = {8030},
  abstract = {This paper presents a review of the pulse tube refrigerator from its inception in the mid-1960s up 
to the present.  Various factors are discussed which brought it from a laboratory curiosity to the 
point where it is now the most efficient of all cryocoolers and reliable enough to be used on 
space missions.  Carnot efficiencies as high as about 20% at 80 K and temperatures as low as 2 K 
have been achieved in pulse tube refrigerators.  The operating principles for the different types of 
pulse tube and thermoacoustic refrigerators are described.  Pulse tube refrigerators operate with 
oscillating pressures and mass flows and have no moving parts in the cold end.  For large 
industrial systems the mechanical compressor can be replaced with one of two types of 
thermoacoustic drivers to yield a refrigerator with no moving parts.  Recent advances in 
understanding and reducing losses in various components are described that have led to the 
improved efficiencies.  The major problems associated with cryocoolers are listed, and it is 
shown that pulse tube refrigerators have begun to overcome many of these problems.  As a 
result, they are now being used or considered for many different applications.  Some of these 
applications as well as example pulse tube refrigerators are described. 
 
Introduction 
 
     The vapor-compression refrigerator, first developed in the latter part of the 19th century, has 
provided most of the world’s refrigeration needs during the 20th century.  In a single stage it can 
produce temperatures down to about 230 K (-43 °C), provided the appropriate refrigerant is used.  
Since the middle of the 20th century a steadily increasing demand for cryogenic temperatures 
(<120 K) has developed for a wide variety of applications.  Initially most of these applications 
were for the liquefaction of air and natural gas, for which very large plants have been developed.  
Power inputs of many megawatts are typical for these systems.  More recently a need for small 
cryogenic refrigerators (cryocoolers) has evolved for a variety of applications.  The requirements 
imposed in each of these applications have been difficult to meet and have been the impetus for 
considerable research and development in the field of cryocoolers for the past 40 years or so. 
     Table 1 lists the main problems associated with cryocoolers that have hampered the 
advancement of many applications.  For example, superconductivity would be in more 
widespread use now if it were not for the problems associated with the cryocoolers needed to 
cool the superconductors.  One such cryocooler, the pulse tube refrigerator, first conceived in the 
mid-1960s, was of academic interest until the mid-1980s.  Since then, improvements in its 
efficiency have occurred rapidly.  Unlike the Stirling or Gifford-McMahon refrigerators, it has 
no moving parts at the cold end.  One variation has also been developed with no moving parts in},

  title  = {FEMM 4.2 Magnetostatic Tutorial1 David Meeker dmeeker@ieee.org January 25, 2006 1. Introduction Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) is a finite element package for solving 2D planar and axisymmetric problems in low frequency magnetics and electrostatics. The program runs under runs under Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP. The program can be obtained via the FEMM home page at http://femm.foster-miller.com. The package is composed of an interactive shell encompassing graphical pre- and post- processing; a mesh generator; and various solvers. A powerful scripting language, Lua 4.0, is integrated with the program. Lua allows users to create batch runs, describe geometries parametrically, perform optimizations, etc. Lua is also integrated into every edit box in the program so that formulas can be entered in lieu of numerical values, if desired. (Detailed information on Lua is available from http://www.lua.org.) There is no hard limit on problem size—maximum problem size is limited by the amount of available memory. Users commonly perform simulations with as many as a million elements. The purpose of this document is to present a step-by-step tutorial to help new users get "up and running" with FEMM. In this document, the solution for the field of an air-cored coil is considered. 2. Model Construction and Analysis This will take you through a step-by-step process to analyze the magnetic field of an air- cored solenoid sitting in open space. The coil to be analyzed is pictured in Figure 1. The coil has an inner diameter of 1 inch; an outer diameter of 3 inches; and an axial length of 2 inches. The coil is built out of 1000 turns of 18 AWG copper wire. For the purposes of this example, we will consider the case in which a steady current of 1 Amp is flowing through the wire. In FEMM, one models a slice of the axisymmetric problem. By convention, the r = 0 axis is understood to run vertically, and the problem domain is restricted to the region where r ≥ 0 . In this convention, positive-valued currents flow in the into-the-page direction},

  abstract = {-An improved sessile drop technique which prevented the oxidation of aluminum was used to
measure the changes in contact angle between boron nitride and molten aluminum in a purified He-3% H 2 
between 1173 and 1373 K. The contact angle progressed through the four wetting phases similar to other 
ceramics when the results were plotted on a logarithmic time scale. However, at and above 1273 K the 
equilibrium contact angle was 0 ° which is much less than those of typical ceramics. Using the value in 
phase II, the original contact angle between boron nitride and aluminum (contact angle between 
non-reacted boron nitride and aluminum) was estimated to be 133 ° at 1373 K. The wetting progressed 
by producing another non-wetting material, AIN, in this non-wetting system. The detailed mechanism of 
the solid/liquid/vapor interfacial advance during wetting in such a system was also explained using Cassie's 
equation.},

  abstract = {A comparative analysis of the experimental results of the properties of fresh and hardened concrete with different replacement ratios of natural with recycled coarse aggregate is presented in the paper. Recycled aggregate was made by crushing the waste concrete of laboratory test cubes and precast concrete columns. Three types of concrete mixtures were tested: concrete made entirely with natural aggregate (NAC) as a control concrete and two types of concrete made with natural fine and recycled coarse aggregate (50% and 100% replacement of coarse recycled aggregate). Ninety-nine specimens were made for the testing of the basic properties of hardened concrete. Load testing of reinforced concrete beams made of the investigated concrete types is also presented in the paper. Regardless of the replacement ratio, recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) had a satisfactory performance, which did not differ significantly from the performance of control concrete in this experimental research. However, for this to be fulfilled, it is necessary to use quality recycled concrete coarse aggregate and to follow the specific rules for design and production of this new concrete type.},

  title    = {Virtual Restoration of Stained Chinese Paintings Using Patch-Based Color Constrained Poisson Editing with Selected Hyperspectral Feature Bands},
  abstract = {Stains, as one of most common degradations of paper cultural relics, not only affect paintings’ appearance, but sometimes even cover the text, patterns, and colors contained in the relics. Virtual restorations based on common red–green–blue images (RGB) which remove the degradations and then fill the lacuna regions with the image’s known parts with the inpainting technology could produce a visually plausible result. However, due to the lack of information inside the degradations, they always yield inconsistent structures when stains cover several color materials. To effectively remove the stains and restore the covered original contents of Chinese paintings, a novel method based on Poisson editing is proposed by exploiting the information inside the degradations of selected three feature bands as the auxiliary information to guide the restoration since the selected feature bands captured fewer stains and could expose the covered information. To make the Poisson editing suitable for stain removal, the feature bands were also exploited to search for the optimal patch for the pixels in the stain region, and the searched patch was used to construct the color constraint on the original Poisson editing to ensure the restoration of the original color of paintings. Specifically, this method mainly consists of two steps: feature band selection from hyperspectral data by establishing rules and reconstruction of stain contaminated regions of RGB image with color constrained Poisson editing. Four Chinese paintings (‘Fishing’, ‘Crane and Banana’, ‘the Hui Nationality Painting’, and ‘Lotus Pond and Wild Goose’) with different color materials were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Visual results show that this method can effectively remove or dilute the stains while restoring a painting’s original colors. By comparing values of restored pixels with nonstained pixels (reference of their same color materials), images processed by the proposed method had the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE), normalized absolute error (NAE), and average differences (AD), which indicates that it is an effective method to restore the stains of Chinese paintings.},

  abstract = {The thermal and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) random copolymers (PEVA) and its covalently crosslinked analogues (cPEVA) were controlled by the overall crystallinity of the polymer networks. The cPEVAs with different VA-content were synthesized by thermally-induced crosslinking of linear PEVA with dicumyl peroxide (DCP). This work was mainly concerned with the effect of vinyl acetate (VA) content on the crosslinking density, thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs, respectively. The chemical composition was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis and 1H-NMR. The thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs have been studied through a series of conventional analytical methods, including gel content determination, different scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and traditional mechanical measurements. The experimental results show that the thermal and mechanical properties of PEVAs and cPEVAs increase with decreasing the VA-content. A broad melting transition with a Tm in the range from 78 C to 95 C was observed for all polymer networks.},

  abstract = {Ternary blend films were prepared with different ratios of starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/citric acid. The films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), thermogravimetric analysis, as well as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The influence of different ratios of starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/citric acid and different drying times on the performance properties, transparency, tensile strength (TS), water vapor permeability (WVP), water solubility (WS), color difference (E), and antimicrobial activity of the ternary blends films were investigated. The starch/polyvinyl alcohol/citric acid (S/P/C1:1:0, S/P/C3:1:0.08, and S/P/C3:3:0.08) films were all highly transparent. The S/P/C3:3:0.08 had a 54.31 times water-holding capacity of its own weight and its mechanical tensile strength was 46.45 MPa. In addition, its surface had good uniformity and compactness. The S/P/C3:1:0.08 and S/P/C3:3:0.08 showed strong antimicrobial activity to Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli, which were the food-borne pathogenic bacteria used. The freshness test results of fresh figs showed that all of the blends prevented the formation of condensed water on the surface of the film, and the S/P/C3:1:0.08 and S/P/C3:3:0.08 prevented the deterioration of figs during storage. The films can be used as an active food packaging system due to their strong antibacterial effect.},

The intent of this technical note is to identify and discuss five key areas of DRAM controller design, including controller requirements, controller clock domains, transmit circuits, capture circuits, strobe detection, and strobe delay circuits. As band- width requirements have increased for high-speed DRAM memory systems, such as high-speed networking, so, too, have the design challenges increased. For example, with DDR3 data rates pushing 1.6 GHz, designing the logic interface has become particularly challenging. And to deal with smaller data valid windows, many areas in the transmit and receive circuits need to be enhanced},

Each segment of the miniaturized robot is actuated by a pair of solenoids, and in-phase and out-of-phase actuations of the solenoid pair cause the linear and turning motions. The theoretical analysis on the actuation force by the solenoid with the magnetic plunger is implemented based on the Biot-Savart law. The optimal design parameters of the solenoid are determined to actuate a segmented body. We manufacture the miniaturized robot consisting of two segments and a pair of solenoids. Experiments are performed to measure the linear and angular displacements of the two-segmented robot for various 
frictional conditions.},

Many problems consist of a structured grid of points that
are updated repeatedly based on the values of a fixed set -1 4 -1
of neighboring points in the same grid. To parallelize these
problems we can geometrically divide the grid into chunks -1
that are processed by different processors. One challenge (a) 5-Point Stencil
with this approach is that the update of points at the pe-
riphery of a chunk requires values from neighboring chunks.
These are often located in remote memory belonging to dif- Process 1 Process 2

applications in solar-thermal and photovoltaic energy conversion. Here, we report novel
tandem structures combing two different materials with complementary optical properties and
microstructures: copper oxide (CuO) nanowires (NWs) and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles
(NPs). Copper oxide NWs of 100–200 nm in diameter and 5 mm long are grown thermally on
copper foil in air and cobalt oxide NPs of 100–200 nm in diameter are synthesized hydro-
thermally. Tandem structures of spectrally selective coating (SSC) layer are built with three
different methods: spray-coating, dip-coating of cobalt oxide NPs into copper oxide NWs forest,
and transferring of copper oxide NWs layer onto cobalt oxide NPs layer. The tandem-structured
SSC layers fabricated from the spray-coating, dip-coating and transferring methods exhibit
figure of merit (FOM) values of 0.875, 0.892 and 0.886, respectively, which are significantly
higher than that of the starting copper oxide NWs (FOM=0.858) and cobalt oxide NPs

  abstract = {This review compiles information regarding the use of alginate, and in particular alginate hydrogels, in culturing cells in 3D. Knowledge of alginate chemical structure and functionality are shown to be important parameters in design of alginate-based matrices for cell culture. Gel elasticity as well as hydrogel stability can be impacted by the type of alginate used, its concentration, the choice of gelation technique (ionic or covalent), and divalent cation chosen as the gel inducing ion. The use of peptide-coupled alginate can control cellâ•ﬁmatrix interactions. Gelation of alginate with concomitant immobilization of cells can take various forms. Droplets or beads have been utilized since the 1980s for immobilizing cells. Newer matrices such as macroporous scaffolds are now entering theÂ€3D cell culture product market. Finally, delayed gelling, injectable, alginate systems show utility in the translation of in vitro cell culture to in vivo tissue engineering applications. Alginate has a history and a future in 3D cell culture. Historically, cells were encapsulated in alginate droplets cross-linked with calcium for the development of artificial organs. Now, several commercial products based on alginate are being used as 3D cell culture systems that also demonstrate the possibility of replacing or regenerating tissue.},

  title    = {Analytical Formulation of the Electric Field Induced by Electrode Arrays: Towards Automated Dielectrophoretic Cell Sorting},
  abstract = {Dielectrophoresis is defined as the motion of an electrically polarisable particle in a non-uniform electric field. Current dielectrophoretic devices enabling sorting of cells are mostly controlled in open-loop applying a predefined voltage on micro-electrodes. Closed-loop control of these devices would enable to get advanced functionalities and also more robust behavior. Currently, the numerical models of dielectrophoretic force are too complex to be used in real-time closed-loop control. The aim of this paper is to propose a new type of models usable in this framework. We propose an analytical model of the electric field based on Fourier series to compute the dielectrophoretic force produced by parallel electrode arrays. Indeed, this method provides an analytical expression of the electric potential which decouples the geometrical factors (parameter of our system), the voltages applied on electrodes (input of our system), and the position of the cells (output of our system). Considering the Newton laws on each cell, it enables to generate easily a dynamic model of the cell positions (output) function of the voltages on electrodes (input). This dynamic model of our system is required to design the future closed-loop control law. The predicted dielectrophoretic forces are compared to a numerical simulation based on finite element model using COMSOL software. The model presented in this paper enables to compute the dielectrophoretic force applied to a cell by an electrode array in a few tenths of milliseconds. This model could be consequently used in future works for closed-loop control of dielectrophoretic devices.},

center-of-mass of the beam and act as a monitor for the longitudinal bunch

using the transfer impedance concept. Different realizations of BPMs are dis-
cussed with the focus on the capacitive linear-cut, button types and stripline
BPMs. Wall current monitor based systems and cavity BPM are briefly men-
tioned. Examples for the design criteria with respect to position sensitivity
and linearity are given. The beam’s center is determined on quite different
time scales from µs for bunch-by-bunch observation up to s for precise closed
orbit determination. The resulting requirements for the analogue and digital
electronics are discussed.},

  abstract = {The 3 method is an attractive technique for measuring the thermal conductivity of materials; but it cannot characterise high thermal conductivity ultra-thin film/substrate systems because of the deep heat penetration depth. Recently, a modified 3 method with a nano-strip was specifically developed for high thermal conductivity thin film systems. This paper aims to evaluate the applicability of this method with the aid of the finite element analysis. To this end, a numerical platform of the modified 3 method was established and applied to a bulk silicon and an AlN thin-film/Si substrate system. The numerical results were compared with the predictions of theoretical models used in the 3 method. The study thus concluded that the modified 3 method is suitable for characterising high thermal conductivity ultra-thin film/substrate systems.},

  abstract = {We present long optical and radio frequency (RF) time series of lightning
events observed with the FORTE satellite in January 2000. Each record contains multiple
RF and optical impulses. We use the RF signatures to identify the general type of
discharge for each impulse according to the discrimination techniques described by
Suszcynsky et al. (2000) and reviewed herein. We see a large number of paired, impulsive
events in the RF which allow us to study the heights within clouds of several events. We
also see that the rate of RF/optical coincidence depends on the type of discharge: nearly
100% of VHF signals from first negative return strokes have an associated optical signal,
whereas a mere 50% of impulsive intracloud events appear to have an optical counterpart.
While the RF signals from ground strokes clearly coincide with simple optical signals in
almost all cases, the intracloud lightning often shows nearly continuous, complicated RF
and optical emissions which do not cleanly correlate with one another. The RF and optical
pulses do not show a well-defined relationship of intensities, for any lightning type. The
observed delay between the RF and optical pulses we interpret as mainly an effect of the
scattering experienced by the light as it traverses the cloud. For intracloud lightning, we
find no evidence of an intrinsic delay at the source between the onset of the RF and
optical signals. Impulsive in-cloud RF events are seen to occur on average every 0.9 ms
during a flash.},

gamma irradiation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) samples. Considerations concerning the influence of 
these parameters on HDPE mechanical strength properties as a result of the predominance of oxidative 
degradation or of cross-linking are presented. The experimental results show an improvement of HDPE 
mechanical strength as dose increases, indicating the predominance of cross-linking over oxidative 
degradation and that lower doses are necessary to obtain a similar change in resistance parameters when 
radiation is applied at lower dose rates, showing that gamma radiation affects the HDPE in a more efficient 
way at lower dose rates.

decisions surrounding the launch of the Challenger, particularly with reference to an
analysis of this event by Edward Tufte. The engineers at Morton Thiokol recommended
against the launch of Challenger because the projected launch temperature between
26°F to 29°F was far outside their field database of successful launches. The engineers
had asked for, but not received, data necessary to determine the cause of massive
blow-by on the launch the previous January, and they had informed their managers
and NASA that continuing flights could be catastrophic if the cause of the problems
with the launches was not discovered. The authors conclude that the engineers thus did
what they were ethically as well as professionally obligated to do.},

  abstract = {Using vacuum die casting, 0.8 mm-thick plates in complicated shapes are manufactured with the highly castable aluminum alloy Silafont-36 (AlSi9MgMn). The sizes and shapes of the cavities, made of thin plates, feature four different mazes. To investigate formability and mechanical properties by shot condition, a total of six parameters (melt temperatures of 730 Â°C and 710 Â°C; plunger speeds of 3.0 m/s and 2.5 m/s; vacuum pressure of 250 mbar and no vacuum) are varied in experiments, and corresponding simulations are performed. Simulation results obtained through MAGMA software show similar tendencies to those of the experiments. When the melt pouring temperature is set to 730 Â°C rather than 710 Â°C, formability and mechanical properties are superior, and when the plunger speed is set to 3.0 m/s rather than to 2.5 m/s, a fine, even structure is obtained with better mechanical properties. The non-vacuumed sample is half unfilled. The tensile strength and elongation of the sample fabricated under a melt temperature of 730 Â°C, plunger speed of 3.0 m/s, and vacuum pressure of 250 mbar are 265 MPa and 8.5%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The electrostatic force can be used to create novel relative motion between
charged bodies if it can be isolated from the stronger gravitational and dissipative forces.
Recently, Coulomb orbital motion was demonstrated on the International Space Station
by releasing charged water droplets in the vicinity of a charged knitting needle. In this
investigation, the Multi-Sphere Method, an electrostatic model developed to study active
spacecraft position control by Coulomb charging, is used to simulate the complex orbital
motion of the droplets. When atmospheric drag is introduced, the simulated motion closely
mimics that seen in the video footage of the experiment. The electrostatic force’s inverse
dependency on separation distance near the center of the needle lends itself to analytic
predictions of the radial motion.},

decisions surrounding the launch of the Challenger, particularly with reference to an
analysis of this event by Edward Tufte. The engineers at Morton Thiokol recommended
against the launch of Challenger because the projected launch temperature between
26°F to 29°F was far outside their field database of successful launches. The engineers
had asked for, but not received, data necessary to determine the cause of massive
blow-by on the launch the previous January, and they had informed their managers
and NASA that continuing flights could be catastrophic if the cause of the problems
with the launches was not discovered. The authors conclude that the engineers thus did
what they were ethically as well as professionally obligated to do.},

  abstract = {Using vacuum die casting, 0.8 mm-thick plates in complicated shapes are manufactured with the highly castable aluminum alloy Silafont-36 (AlSi9MgMn). The sizes and shapes of the cavities, made of thin plates, feature four different mazes. To investigate formability and mechanical properties by shot condition, a total of six parameters (melt temperatures of 730 Â°C and 710 Â°C; plunger speeds of 3.0 m/s and 2.5 m/s; vacuum pressure of 250 mbar and no vacuum) are varied in experiments, and corresponding simulations are performed. Simulation results obtained through MAGMA software show similar tendencies to those of the experiments. When the melt pouring temperature is set to 730 Â°C rather than 710 Â°C, formability and mechanical properties are superior, and when the plunger speed is set to 3.0 m/s rather than to 2.5 m/s, a fine, even structure is obtained with better mechanical properties. The non-vacuumed sample is half unfilled. The tensile strength and elongation of the sample fabricated under a melt temperature of 730 Â°C, plunger speed of 3.0 m/s, and vacuum pressure of 250 mbar are 265 MPa and 8.5%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The electrostatic force can be used to create novel relative motion between
charged bodies if it can be isolated from the stronger gravitational and dissipative forces.
Recently, Coulomb orbital motion was demonstrated on the International Space Station
by releasing charged water droplets in the vicinity of a charged knitting needle. In this
investigation, the Multi-Sphere Method, an electrostatic model developed to study active
spacecraft position control by Coulomb charging, is used to simulate the complex orbital
motion of the droplets. When atmospheric drag is introduced, the simulated motion closely
mimics that seen in the video footage of the experiment. The electrostatic force’s inverse
dependency on separation distance near the center of the needle lends itself to analytic
predictions of the radial motion.},
