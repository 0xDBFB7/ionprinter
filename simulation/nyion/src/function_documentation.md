# A Cell is the small region in a refined mesh. A Block is a set of cells.


//maybe an index function into the struct? What return value?

A 500K saved timesteps from a 10M mesh would be ~20 TB; however we probably don't want the meshes, but the particles.

A lot of programs have huge config files and tons of options for flexibility.
This program should be built on the paradigm of 'sensible defaults':
an engineer should be able to import a mesh and have it just be solved.


Less than 15 years ago this level of performance would have cost $150,000 (3 TFLOPS).

(TF is a useless metric, but approximately)

born too late to explore the earth,
born too early to explore the galaxy,
born just in time to build some seriously awesome stuff?

now a single card can do >100 Tflops fp16

that's FRIGGIN AMAZING
