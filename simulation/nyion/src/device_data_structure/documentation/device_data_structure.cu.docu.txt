Install https://atom.io/packages/scroll-sync for the magic!
or set scrollbind in vim
It's somewhat difficult to document code without making each source file bulky, unwieldy and
difficult to navigate - c.f. literate programming.
but you still want to have a spatial correspondence between the words and the source.
This sort of two-pane doc would be great,
especially if there was some sort of active system anchoring things in sync...

You can type whatever you want (even below next function), then '%%>> clip', script copies cut-off description to the bottom of the page.

if you type '%%>> ...', the script pastes the rest of the description from below.

functions, #defines added to files are automatically copied here.

Non-whitespace is never clipped when syncing positions unless >>clip is called.
